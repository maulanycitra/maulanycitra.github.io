The **Generasi Bebas Plastik** initiative has been successfully completed, bringing together a community dedicated to reducing plastic waste. Over two weeks, participants engaged in activities like sorting and recycling waste, creating educational content, and visiting recycling facilities to gain deeper insights into sustainable practices.  

This program aimed to build better waste management habits, raise public awareness, and inspire collective action to tackle the global issue of plastic waste. Notable outcomes include a reduction in the use of single-use plastics and an increase in the adoption of reusable items such as bottles, bags, and food containers.

The **Generasi Bebas Plastik** team remains committed to further promoting sustainable lifestyles and encouraging everyone to take small yet impactful actions in their daily lives. Together, we can make a difference in reducing environmental harm caused by plastic waste.
