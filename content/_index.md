        I am actively involved in various activities focusing on education, plastic waste management, and technology development. Here are some of my key focuses:
        
        - Teaching elementary school students in subjects like IPAS, Mathematics, and Javanese Language.
        - Participating in the "Plastic-Free Generation" Project to raise environmental awareness.
        - Developing a Python learning module registered under copyright protection (HaKI).
        
        I am also working on creating inspiring social media content related to education and the laundry business I manage. Feel free to reach out for collaboration!ðŸ˜ƒ
